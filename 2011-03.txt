  text: "=== ICSOFT11 Paper Review===\n\n33: **Transactions And Cloud Databases**\n\
    \ \n//Abstract/Introduction:// \n- Somewhat incoherent: What exactly are the shortcomings\
    \ of ElasTras, VoltDB and Xeround compared to Pyrrho DBMS\n- What are the mentioned\
    \ \"elegant solutions\" for preserving ACID properties in transactions\n- It is\
    \ not becoming clear that the Pyrrho DBMS is at the center of interest. \n- A\
    \ non existing \"section 8\" is being referenced \n- \"Optimistic concurrency\
    \ model\" is used throughout the paper but never defined.\n\n\n//Partitioning\
    \ a Database://\n- What are the implications/challanges of partitioning a database.\
    \ Or is this a straight forward process? Answering this in place would be important\
    \ for the reader.\nTypo: \"Pyrrho only modified...\" should spell \"Pyrrho only\
    \ modifies...\" or be explained further.\n- Not detailed enough example in the\
    \ last paragraph. Is this describing a failover mechanism? In hich way does the\
    \ presumably distributed and moved to another server data reappear in the base\
    \ database without additional effort? An explenation in greater detail is required.\n\
    \n\n//Example Partitioning Example://\n- The client needs knowledge of the nature\
    \ of the partitioning. Are there suggestions on how to handle this?\n\n\n//Cloud\
    \ Computing//\n- Referencing a not included section 10\n- Differences between\
    \ direct and indirect access should be explained more\n- Referencing a not included\
    \ section 8.5\n\n\n//Transaction Rate and Benchmarking//\n- Figure using confusing\
    \ non-sense entries\n\n\n//Conclusion//\n- Referred to discussion of SQL2008 complience\
    \ and ACID requirements are not given in the paper.\n\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n[OLTP\
    \ \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing\"\"] - Online\
    \ transaction processing\n\n [ACID \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID\"\"](atomicity,\
    \ consistency, isolation, durability)\n\nThe [CAP theorem \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem\"\
    \"], also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed\
    \ computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:\n\
    + Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)\n+ Availability (node\
    \ failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate)\n+ Partition tolerance\
    \ (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss)\n\n\n[Stored\
    \ procedures \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure\"\"]: A stored\
    \ procedure is a subroutine available to applications accessing a relational database\
    \ system. Typical uses for stored procedures include data validation (integrated\
    \ into the database) or access control mechanisms.\n\n[Serialization \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization\"\
    \"]: In computer science, in the context of data storage and transmission, serialization\
    \ is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can\
    \ be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a\
    \ network connection link) and \"resurrected\" later in the same or another computer\
    \ environment\n\n38: **AUTOMATIC INSERTION OF BUSINESS RULES IMPLEMENTATION IN\
    \ RELATIONAL DATABASE**\n\n//General//\n- Incorrect grammer\n- Convoluted senetence\
    \ structure\n- Insufficient interpunction\n- Formating errors (incorrect line\
    \ breaks)\n- Inconsistent senetence structures hinder understanding\n- Pieces\
    \ of examples are not clearly seperated from text flow\n- Invalid XML in examples\n\
    - Poorly formated tables\n- Exemples are given in a mix of Spanish and English\n\
    - Granularity of section numbering is too high\n- Duplicates in reference list\n\
    - Very limited presentation of related work\n- Literal repetitions  \n\n\n===Future\
